                        This projects aims to be a centralized hub for data revelant
                        to HAM radio operators.<br>
                        The data consists of publicly available data and is provided
                        freely (as in &quot;free of charge&quot; as well as in
                        &quot;freedom&quot;) but without any warranty.<br>

                        <a href="https://eddb.io/">eddb.io</a>.

                        This project was initiated by
                        <a href="mailto:hamdb@hb9akm.ch">HB9AKM</a>.
                        He's also responsible for this site.<br>
                        A privacy consent (/cookie) message is, as far as I
                        understand the rules of GDPR, not necessary. There is no
                        data stored (except the data necessary to operate the
                        server). There is absolutely no data stored longtime
                        (to my knowledge server logs are dropped after 14 days).
                        Currently, this site does not use any cookies. If it will
                        they will be what GDPR calls something like &quot;essential&quot;
                        cookies.<br>
                        To my knowledge, there is absolutely no need for websites
                        to have a consent message.
